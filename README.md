# Recolor
Indie Game made by Unity; 2020 Netease Game: College Mini-Game work

## Description
This is a game about colors. Three mysterious monsters suddenly appear, destructed human homes and took the three primary colors. The world loses color, and all objects are left with only black or white. The prophet claimed that if a warrior defeated three color monsters to retrieve the energy orbs, which represent the three primary colors, 
and put them into the hall, the world would be restored to its original state. Thus, warriors set out to challenge the monster's habitat, but some failed miserably, and others never returned.
You are the last hope of human, can save this color wasteland or not, it depends on your efforts and wisdom!
